<h3>About Me</h3>
<p style="max-width: 90%; font-size:14px;">
I recently (February 2024) received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from 
Georgetown University. In the fall, I will be starting a new position 
as an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department of Amherst College!

<p style="max-width: 90%; font-size:14px;">
My research is in the area of natural language processing and I am 
specifically interested in computational semantics (across languages) and 
model evaluation practices. My research has been supported by a Clare Boothe Luce 
scholarship and I have previously completed research at Google, the University of 
Southern California, and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
In addition to research, I am passionate about teaching and mentorship.
