My research interests include computational semantics, model evaluation, translated texts,
multilingualism / cross-lingual methods, and corpus linguistics.
Broadly, I’m currently working on: (1) meaning across languages and (2) evaluation practices.

My recently completed dissertation, “Development & Evaluation of Cross-lingual Abstract Meaning Representation,” 
considered the applications and assessments of extension of a semantic representation (Abstract Meaning Representation)
to languages beyond English. My doctoral advisor was Nathan Schneider. The other members of my 
dissertation committee were Martha Palmer, Marine Carpuat, Ophir Frieder, Nazli Goharian, and Justin Thaler.
