<h3>Research Lab</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
My research lab is called <b>ACNLP</b> (Amherst College Natural Language Processing). 
I will be looking to take on and advise
undergraduate research assistants at Amherst. If you are interested in joining the lab, please fill out 
<a href="https://forms.gle/C7wkgSUAgM3B5zMd9">this interest form.</a> Thank you!

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
My research interests include computational semantics, model evaluation, translated texts,
multilingualism/cross-lingual methods, and corpus linguistics.
Broadly, Iâ€™m currently working on: (1) meaning across languages and (2) evaluation practices.
</p>
<br/>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
My <b>Doctoral Dissertation</b>, titled "Development & Evaluation of Cross-lingual Abstract Meaning Representation,"
considered the applications and assessments of extension of a semantic representation (Abstract Meaning Representation)
to languages beyond English. My doctoral advisor was Nathan Schneider. The other members of my 
dissertation committee were Martha Palmer, Marine Carpuat, Ophir Frieder, Nazli Goharian, and Justin Thaler.

<p style="font-size:15px;">
My <b>Undergraduate Senior Honors Thesis</b> in Computer Science and Spanish ("Sentiment Analysis on Translated Works: 
Explaining the Differences Between Linguistic Analysis of a Text and its Computational Sentiment") 
was co-advised by Joann Ordille and Michelle Geoffrion-Vinci. For this work I was awarded the 
Barge Oratorical Prize, for the most skilled oral defense of an honors thesis that year.
